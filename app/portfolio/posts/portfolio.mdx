## Technical Details

The website uses Next.js's new App Router for improved performance and better SEO. Content is managed through MDX files, allowing for rich markdown content with React components. The design is implemented using Tailwind CSS for consistent styling and dark mode support.

The architecture separates concerns between pages, components, and utilities. Blog and portfolio posts are stored as MDX files and processed at build time, with metadata extracted from frontmatter.
