title: "A Framework for Researching Product Companies"
publishedAt: "2024-10-14"
summary: "I often do in-depth research on different tech companies. Over time, I’ve collected a number of free-ish tools that I like to use during the research and also refined the framework that helps me look at a company from different angles. Research goals might be very different — competitor analysis, job search, or even company valuation; but the tools and templates that I use are mostly the same."

Throughout the years of being involved in tech industry, I've developed an approach to analyzing companies using freely available tools. Whether you're conducting competitor analysis, job hunting, or performing company valuations, this framework helps examine organizations from multiple angles.

## 0. Getting Started

Before diving deep, I start with these basic steps to get familiar with a company: review the official website; examine their LinkedIn; browse job boards (BuiltIn, Indeed, Glassdoor, Wellfound) to understand their hiring needs and self-presentation to prosepct employees;
check overview platforms like Crunchbase (free trial), PitchDeck, Craft.co, Owler, and for mobile apps, Data.ai and Sensor Tower. Next, I fill out the following template:

## I. Company Overview

#### Product Offerings

Key Questions:

- What products does the company create?
- How do these products complement each other?
- What use cases do they address?

Research Sources:

- Company website (noting potential sales and marketing bias);
- API documentation and support docs (typically provides a less bias understanding of what is available on the platform today);
- Youtube, Video videos of the product demo;
- GitHub repositories (both company-owned and related projects);
- Also, at times, ChatGPT gives a much better description of what the company does than their marketing materials.

## III. Cultural Assessment

Key Areas

- Company culture and values
- Historical development
- Leadership background
- Organizational structure

Research Sources:

## IV. Last Step

While this framework provides a structured approach to company research, it's important to remember that each analysis should be tailored to your specific needs. The true value comes from consistently gathering data across these different dimensions and identifying patterns that others might miss. Whether you're evaluating a potential employer, analyzing a competitor, or conducting due diligence for an investment, the key is to maintain a systematic approach while remaining flexible enough to dive deeper into areas that prove most relevant. I've found that regular practice with this framework improves the quality of research and helps develop a stronger intuition for spotting opportunities and red flags. Remember that the best insights often come from connecting dots across different areas of analysis – a company's culture might explain its product decisions, or its financial metrics might reveal its true strategic priorities.
